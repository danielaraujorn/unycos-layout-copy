## Testing

---

1.  You can easily test this app in your machine by cloning this repository. Then, on the project folder, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

2.  You will also need to set your Marvel API public key as an environment variable. Simply create a `.env` file in the root folder by copying the contents of the `.env.example` file or inserting the following lines:

        PORT=9004
        SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true

3.  After everything is set, you can run `npm start` to run the app on your localhost.
